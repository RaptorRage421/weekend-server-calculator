# Server Side Calculator

Duration: Weekend Sprint

We were tasked with creating a basic calculator, that will take a client side input of two numbers and a math operator "+","-","*",or "/". This will take the input and do run the equation and display the answer on the page, with an equation history available as well. 

## Examples
    1+34 would return 35
    6*3 would return 18
    36/9 would return 4


    This project required the use of axios POST and GET requests to take user input, run a calculation based on the input, and then display the result. This required taking the input of the math operator, and storing it on the client side, then when the input values are submitted it is sent along with the numbers, and it is sent through the calculation function, which identifies the operator and runs the calculation based on that.
